... aims to display Google Calendar events on a linear timeline.

== Getting Started ==

1. `git clone git://github.com/lowerkey/timeline.git`
2. run `index.html` in Google Chrome.

== Current Development/Next Steps ==

This project could use a github page displaying the current work.
Other than that, the next step will be to load Google Calendar events 
and display them as lines above the timeline. 
After that, adding new events through this interface, something like
clicking and dragging the mouse.
